Welcome to **Glow Up**, a personal makeup website where users can browse beauty products, read tips, contact the makeup artist, and more. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with features powered by **Mailchimp** and **db.json** (JSON Server).

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Many makeup lovers and beauty service providers depend heavily on platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok to showcase their work. These platforms limit organization, searchability, and professional presentation. A dedicated website offers a better way to display products and connect with clients more efficiently.
